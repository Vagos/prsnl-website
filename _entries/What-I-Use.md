### Operating System

On my main desktop machine I have Windows 10 dual booted with Arch Linux and just Arch on my Laptop.

### Music 

I use [ncmcpp](https://github.com/ncmpcpp/ncmpcpp) as my music client together with [Mopidy](https://docs.mopidy.com/en/latest/installation/). 

Mopidy has an amazing collection of plugins where you can basically combine music from Youtube, Spotify and Soundcloud into one central music player.

### Text Editor

I use [vim](https://github.com/vim/vim) for prettty much anything. In conjuction with plugins like [CoC](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) it's a fully fledged IDE, but runs fast.

### Browser

[qutebrowser](https://www.qutebrowser.org/index.html) for most of my browsing needs. The browser has vim keybindings and a lot of customisation options.

### Document Writing

I use [LateX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) for all of my academic papers. There is a learning curve but if you are still using Microsoft Word, I suggest to give it a try. 

### Music Production 

[FL Studio](https://www.image-line.com/) is the program I'm most familiar and basically, enjoy. Sadly, there are no sensible Linux alternatives for music production, yet. 

### Image Editing 

[GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) is perfect for basic to advanced photo editing. 

### Font

My favorite font has to be [Cozette](https://github.com/slavfox/Cozette). It looks great on any context, plus it includes glyphs compatible with ranger-icons. Most people will tell you bitmap fonts are only good for ricing but they are definetely wrong. Looking cool is definently a bonus.

### Terminal Emulator

[Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) is great. It works out of the box and has a simple, readable config file.

### Window Manager 

[i3](https://i3wm.org/) is the first and last window manager I've installed.
