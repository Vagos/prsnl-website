title:  "Making Videos"
---

### Intro

I've been looking into ways to automate the creating of videos for programming/educational content. 
I've been inspired from a Python library called Manim which lets you create math animations.

I think that making videos through code rather than a GUI application can be faster, easier and more precise. It's also a different workflow that I think some people will benefit from.

### Limitations

The limitations of this way of creating videos are obvious. Complicated sequences that require keyframing would obviously be better suited if you can also see what you are doing while doing it.
Also, creating the video/clip requires "compiling" it. That doesn't work really well if you want a fast feedback loop. More complicated scenes can take some time to be encoded.


### Techical

What the fuck.

```cpp
int a = 3; // Wow so cool!

printf("%d\n", a);
```
