It's time Urbit got some searching capabilities.

For most people, their computer is a bootloader to the closest search engine. Searching is a central part of everyone's computing workflow.

The meta-search engine is able to aggregate results from open search APIs and bring them inside the comfort of your Urbit ship. No longer do you have to keep a second tab open on those "other" search engines.

Let's make searching fun again. :)
