**Evangelos (Vagos) Lamprou**

I am currently a visiting student at Brown working with Prof. [Nikos Vasilakis](https://nikos.vasilak.is/).

My research interests lie in programming-language design, operating
systems, and security.

For some of my projects, visit the [things](/things) page.

My blog is [here](/blog).

I am applying to **PhD programs** this Fall!
