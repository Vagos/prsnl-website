**Evangelos Lamprou**

I am currently working as an embedded software engineer at
[Oticon](https://www.oticon.com/) in Denmark while pursuing my MSc in Computer
Science at [DTU](https://www.dtu.dk/).

Before that, I studied ECE at the University of Patras where I completed my
thesis under the supervision of Prof. [Christos Fidas](http://www.cfidas.info/).
